# Introduction

This repo contains the code used for the course _GraphQL Full Course - Novice to Expert_ on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q). However, the frontend code is improved with more functionality and was done with the lib styled-components along with Functional Components, instead of plain css and class-based components.

Technologies used:

- Nodejs, Mongodb, Express and Graphql on backend (and Mongodb Atlas).
- React, Apollo and Graphql on Frontend.
- Yarn workspaces as package architecture (monorepo).

## Instructions

For the backend:
On a terminal, type `cd packages/backend` then run `yarn dev`;

For the frontend:
On a terminal, type `cd packages/frontend` then run `yarn start`.
